<p>I found this piece absolutely fascinating!  I never really had access to the Internet until I was eleven years old – and by then, it was pretty much the same as it is for us today.  So I had no idea that so many iterations of the web were once proposed!  It is really interesting to think about why one that was apparently relatively simple compared to the others was the one that was chosen to rule them all.  At first, it seemed a little odd that people would overwhelmingly flock to a platform that was less capable of doing fun and awesome and advanced types of things, but the more I though about this phenomenon, the more it made sense.  For several years now, I have been very much enjoying editing videos with various software platforms on my computer.  At the moment, I can hardly imagine my life without Final Cut Pro and all the many options and features that it provides me, but, looking back, if I had used FCP for my very first video project, I probably would have just ended up discouraged.  I wouldn’t have known where to start!  It was much better that I started out with iMovie, a relatively simple and user-friendly editing suite, and moved gradually on up to Final Cut Pro as I became an increasingly proficient editor.  When the web was a brand new concept, people had no clue how to use it.  So while to today’s Internet veterans, the concepts of some of these more advanced, complex browsers sound exciting, to the first Internet pioneers, they probably just seemed confusing and scary.  Whether it’s surfing the web, editing videos, or trying out any kind of new experience, I think the impulse tends to be to start with the basics.  Thinking about all this also reminded me of another phenomenon that I witness now and again while browsing sites like Facebook and YouTube.  Every so often, these sites will modify or add to their features, and when they do, their audience goes crazy!  While people usually adjust to the change in features, they seem to often spend their first few days of using them in a state of panic, anger, and/or confusion.  Sometimes, it really is best just to keep it simple!
