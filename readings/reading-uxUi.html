<p>I really got a lot out of checking out these articles.  It was really great to be able to have articulated in front of me the principles of good design.  I feel like just about anyone can differentiate a good design from a bad one when asked to use a website, but it is sometimes a struggle to do this during the creation process.  I think this has a lot to do with the fact that a designer already knows what she’s making inside and out before she even creates it; a user has no clue.
	In my opinion, one of the most important principles discussed in these readings was the idea that more is not necessarily better.  There is almost nothing I find more mentally distracting than one of those sites with a neon background and sparkles and eight0hundred dancing 3D characters scattered all around.  Sometimes something minimal and sedate really is more effective at communicating information.  It allows what’s most important to stand out.
	Also, crazy sites nowadays are almost always labeled as untrustworthy.  This is a shame, because in years past, I’ve come across a lot of great information from genuinely reputable sources (like authors, doctors, and professors) presented on really awful websites.  Because of nothing more than a lack of web knowledge and some bad design choices, a doctor’s research could be labeled a scam!
	Simplicity is definitely a value I personally will strive to keep in mind!
