<p>I think that the Internet is the ideal platform for art!  Like it says in the article, anyone can be an artist online!  The world’s galleries and museums may only accept hand-chosen pieces from prestigious and well-known creators, but on the world-wide web, there’s a spot for everybody!  Not only can anybody post art on the Internet – there is an audience out there for just about everything!  Sites such as YouTube, Instagram, and even Facebook have proven time and time again that content does not have to come from a well-known source in order for it to be viewed, enjoyed, and even (in some cases) made famous!  Another great thing about the Internet as art and as a platform for art is that it allows art viewers to interact with the pieces.  Various platforms allow users to do things such as “like” and comment on art that moves them, and others even allow them to interact with the artwork!  The ability to engage with art can really help to captivate and engage an audience - whether it’s a complicated multiplayer universe, a simple online game, or even a fun interactive art piece.  The interactive artistic world of the Internet has helped to create friendships, further causes, and bring many ideas to life.  I can’t wait to see this powerful and fun platform continue to be a force for amazingness!
