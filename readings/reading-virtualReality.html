<p>	I think the possibilities for virtual reality in the future are amazing!  Humans have always had the desire to escape into alternate worlds and discover what different universes have to offer – or maybe even visit a beloved land far away or known only in fiction.  I can come up with a lot of amazing uses for VR outside of the entertainment sphere, too.  What about using the technology to help people safely conquer phobias and fears?  Or using it to help train surgeons?  Or to test people’s survival skills without actually endangering them?
	VR definitely has a future in that there are places it could very effectively be used.  The thing that at the moment seems to be standing in its way is an issue of accessibility and ease of use.  Up until recently, I had never really seen anything “VR” in the modern sense.  Because I wasn’t seeing it, I wasn’t thinking about it, and I didn’t really give it that much importance in my world.  But then, a couple of months ago, all these 360-degree videos started popping up on Facebook.  I played with one, and it was amazing!  Now I look forward to when those videos pop up on my newsfeed.  Seeing and playing with these 360-degree videos has made me see VR as a much bigger and more useful emerging technology.
	However, I think VR still has a way to go before it can be fully utilized.  For example, I think the current need for big, expensive headsets and gadgets needs to be worked on.  Once VR devices are more streamlined, affordable, and portable, VR will almost certainly have a greater reach.
	Anyway, I think it is very exciting to be living in a world of emerging technology, and I am looking forward now to seeing what’s next!
