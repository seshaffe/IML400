<h1>Letter of Intent</h1>
<p>I have always loved movies, and for many years, I have been building my own DVD collection.  My favorite thing about my collection is being able to share it with friends.  In order to make doing this possible, once my DVD collection reached a certain size, I began organizing it in to a spreadsheet that could be updated and emailed out.  While a definite improvement on asking people just to flip through pages and pages of discs, a spreadsheet is still not the best possible way for me to make my collection accessible.  Having an updatable website with customizable search features would be the perfect way to accomplish my goal!</p>
